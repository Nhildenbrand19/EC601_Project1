# NFL Health & Safety


## Product Definition
A highly discussed topic as of late, with still far to many unknowns, is the topic of head related injuries in sports and more specifically, CTE in the game of the football. CTE is a term for the degeneration of the brain caused by head traumas. The scariest part of CTE is that it can only be diagnosed after the individual passes away through an autopsy. A new study that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the brains, donated to Boston University, of 202 deceased football players were examined. These players played at a variety of levels from High School all the way up to the NFL. These brains were then analyzed for CTE in conjunction with player history on the field.  Of the 202 players, 87% were diagnosed with CTE while 111 of these players played in the NFL, 110 of which were diagnosed with CTE. This is a very scary, yet very real issue in not on the NFL, but major contact sports and this product aims to help.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74614080/133643066-1dbd224a-a6f1-43e7-a463-ace650bb31eb.png)
